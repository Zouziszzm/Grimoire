# Welcome to the Grimoire

This is the **Grimoire** that holds all the languages I am currently learning and plan to learn.  
It’s an evolving collection of knowledge—constantly growing, updating, and expanding with each new language.  
This grimoire is not yet complete, and it will never be, as knowledge continues to pile up and uncover new possibilities.  
Each spell, phrase, and concept recorded here is just a step on an endless journey of learning.

**Note:** This repository is a work in progress, and the collection will keep growing as I continue my language journey.
